# NKUST Homework Project

## Package Management

This project uses [Uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management. 

## Running Commands

All Python commands should be prefixed with `uv run`. For example:

- `uv run python main.py`
- `uv run jupyter notebook`
- `uv run pytest`

## Jupyter Notebook conversion

- You can convert it with external tools. Install your tool with `uv add --dev <dependencies>`.
- You should make Jupyter Notebook initutive for the editors.
- You should format the code with Ruff only after the notebook is created.

## Environment

- Python version: 3.12
- Package manager: Uv
